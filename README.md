## Requirements

- NodeJS v14+
- Python 3.8 (Python 3.9+ is currently not supported by TensorFlow)

## Installing

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm i
```

### Server

It is recommended to use a python virtual environment or similar to avoid all the dependencies being added system wide to your python install.

To do this on windows:

```bash
cd server
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Note the script to activate the venv may be slightly different on other platforms.

Then installing the dependencies once the virtual environment is active:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you need to exit the virtual environment run:

```bash
venv\Scripts\deactivate
```

from the server directory.

## Running

To run both the client and server respectively it is:

```bash
cd client
npm start
```

```bash
cd server
flask run
```

If your local machine has Bluetooth connectivity, you can connect to the app over `localhost` and do not need to use HTTPS/Ngrok. For example, if the client and sever are running on a laptop that has a Bluetooth adapter, you can connect the micro:bit to the app using the URL `http://localhost:3000`. If this is not possible, you must setup HTTPS or use Ngrok as described below.

### Ngrok

If you need to connect to a micro:bit to any device other than localhost, both the server and client need to be running behind Ngrok. Also the Ngrok URL for the server needs to be set in the configuration file found in `client/src/config.json`

Install Ngrok:

```bash
npm install --global ngrok
```

You may need to restart the terminal at this point if the `ngrok` command is not available in the system path.

Server:

```bash
ngrok http -region=eu 5000
```

Don't forget to update the server URL in `client/src/config.json`.

Client:

```bash
ngrok http -region=eu 3000
```

_Note:_ default ports of server and client are 5000 and 3000 respectively.

### Connecting the micro:bit to a desktop/laptop

You may have to enable a flag in the browser to allow Web Bluetooth connections on desktop. To do this go to the flags page, enable the `Experimental Web Platform Features` flag and re-launch the browser.

#### Browser Flags (Experiments) Page Locations

Enter the URL below in the address bar of your preferred browser to access the flags (Experiments) page

- Google Chrome/Chromium: `chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`
- Microsoft Edge: `edge://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`

## Garbage that needs to be done

- [ ] Remove some boilerplate code still hanging around.
- [x] Update this readme with more garbage to be done.
- [ ] Create new page to store different modules, where they can be created, access their training, and map to some sound.
  - [x] Creation of models to allow name identifier, count of relevant frames (Maybe this needs to be a general amount to make things easier. We are always collecting these ticks anyway, so always run through the 100 ticks? I don't think that this would decrease accuracy on models that only need simple gestures i.e. ones that can be seen in ~20 ticks)
  - [ ] Accessing training of models at any time to provide more data (if user identifies poor model accuracy, allow them to train further.)
- [ ] Encode models on the server to pass to the client.
  - [ ] Saving of models on the server.
- [ ] Upgrade the models from their very simplistic current model.
- [ ] Add TensorFlow JS to the client and create a component to work with it. Ez.
  - [ ] Handle conversion of realtime data to tensors to feed into the model.
  - [ ] Pass out the results to be used by other components.
- [ ] Create a bunch of bad training data.
- [x] Audio component
  - [ ] Handle a number of different audio sounds/files
  - [ ] Play them according to the state of the currently active model.
